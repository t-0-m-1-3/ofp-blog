# Making the move to GoLang
## I have to be the first to admit it, I don't know why I did it
It was probably something to do with all the gophers around.
or maybe it was the amazing community in the slack channel, but I felt
very drawn to learning `go`. 

## What We'll Cover
1. Installing Go on some Operating systems (Copy pasta from the docs)
2. Running a `hello.go` but more like `hello-everything-i-need.go`
3. Next Steps

## Installing GoLang on your OS
*No Matter what happens, remember I love you, despite the errors you may run into*

1. Download the binaries
2. Go Go To The WIKI
3. `apt-get` or `snap`

## Running a hello-everything-i-need.go
hello-everything-i-need.go is designed to be a cheatsheet, namely, my cheatsheet. It's going to grow, it's going to morph, but it will always be a cheatsheet. 
Nothing replaces good wholesome documentation time. 
```
hello-everything-i-need.go

packge main

import (
    "fmt"
    )
func main() {
    fmt.PrintLn("you can go after it")
}

```

## Next Steps
Read those docs 
love those docs
re read your linux (or OS) docs too. It's scary how much `go` taught me I didn't know.
